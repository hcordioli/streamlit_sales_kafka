    The Sales Revenue Dashboard is a compound of techniques to build and deploy dashboards apps using Streamlit library and hosting services.
    I have decide to use two pages to display:
    
      1. Product
      2. Sales
      3. Insights
    
    Just click in one of the options on the left.
    
    Code available in https://github.com/hcordioli/sales_revenue
    
    I hope you enjoy.
